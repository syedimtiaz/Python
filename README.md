# Delete orphaned items from Portal for ArcGIS using python script

Exact error: Unable to reach the server where the service is. Consider using calling deleteItem with options = { 'force' : true } if the server won't be available anymore.

The issue usually occurs when Portal for ArcGIS is unfederated and re-federated or when some configuration changes are made to Portal for ArcGIS.
